Unfortunately they did not fit but the style is great.,positive
"These pants ""fit, as in, I could put them on.  The waist is perfect but the seat/crotch is cut comically too long, which means the top of the inseam hangs almost to my knees.  I seriously have to pull these up to my nips to get the inseam to sit where it should, otherwise these feel like wearing a diaper.  With the inseam hanging so low, the legs then end up being too long and baggy.  These are supposed to ""taper"", but like many pants in larger sizes, the factory must think that all fat dudes have calves and ankles as thick as their thighs because the ankles are massive and bunch up around your shoes in the most unflattering way.  Old Navy needs to redesign the cut on these ASAP.  I bought a blue pair of these same pants a few years back and they were the best cut jeans I've ever owned.  Not a single pair has fit the same since due to how terribly they're cut.  Needless to say, I'm not keeping these.",mixed

They aren't super tight like Zara jeans are, they don't shrink in the wash, the colour is perfect and the stretch… the stretch is just amazing. I am exactly 6 feet and so 30 length is an exact fit and 32 is a tad lag but can be hemmed so that's not an issue.",positive

"I've always had a soft spot for Old Navy jeans. Comfy, durable, and priced just right. I only own another pair of the Relaxed Taper, but I can definitely say that the black ones I got (31x30) fit a bit looser compared to my medium blue pair of the same style. It's a persistent Old Navy issue but I'm fairly happy with them. Perfect for my lazy days or when I'd rather not get my fancy schmancy jeans too dirty.",mixed
