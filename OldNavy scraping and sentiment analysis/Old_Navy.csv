723875002,Athletic Taper Built-In Flex Black Jeans for Men,black rinse,$35.00,1,"""Fits"", terrible cut","These pants ""fit, as in, I could put them on.  The waist is perfect but the seat/crotch is cut comically too long, which means the top of the inseam hangs almost to my knees.  I seriously have to pull these up to my nips to get the inseam to sit where it should, otherwise these feel like wearing a diaper.  With the inseam hanging so low, the legs then end up being too long and baggy.  These are supposed to ""taper"", but like many pants in larger sizes, the factory must think that all fat dudes have calves and ankles as thick as their thighs because the ankles are massive and bunch up around your shoes in the most unflattering way.  Old Navy needs to redesign the cut on these ASAP.  I bought a blue pair of these same pants a few years back and they were the best cut jeans I've ever owned.  Not a single pair has fit the same since due to how terribly they're cut.  Needless to say, I'm not keeping these."
