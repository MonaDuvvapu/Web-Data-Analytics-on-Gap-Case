Love the fit. Gap has been my go-to for years.It hugs the legs after a wash  but then loosens up over time.#sweepstakes,positive
Soft perfect fit,positive
Comfort & size are perfect,positive
These are my sons favorite. We buy a pair every year! He loves the fit and no holes.,positive
#Sweepstakes I love these jeans  I was looking for a light wash that aren't too tight-fitting.,positive
Best jeans ever. The stretch (paired up with the price) is unmatched. Only qualm - more color options please!,positive
I only wear GAP Jeans. But they have to be super stretchy material to fit my body. Gap keeps changing their nomenclature Softflex  or Gapflex. It's hard to keep up and the colour choices are limited. So when I find a colour I like I always order a few at a time.,negative
I've been wearing gap jeans for nearly 15 years and I just purchased this new pair and they fit and look as well as they historically have and we LOVE a pair of light wash jeans and jeans with STRETCH. #sweepstakes,positive
Jeans are slightly darker near the cuff than appear in the photos and run a little tight on the quads  but overall pretty happy with them #sweepstakes,positive
Great fit and versatile jeans. I have three pairs in three colors,positive
Shipped as promised; jeans are as described,positive

"I love those jeans because the ""Gap Flex"" material stretches and while they are ""Straight"" legs they are not like the old days; they are still are stylish. GAP has re-engineered this fit in the right places so they don't seem baggy like years ago. They come in a variety of denim colors  the price is right and have GAP's reputation and services!",positive

"Pants are on the loose fit end(they lay frumpy on my body (maybe it's my body type)!  I'm 5""11 220 lbs stocky build side 34 waist! Will definitely need tailoring($$)",negative
Nicely made. I feel like they are a little bigger than the measurements but nice jeans,positive
Great 90s silhouette  slight distress.,positive
Wrote review as part of #sweepstakes.The good: Wash is really well done. Got compliments on it.Rise and fit are exactly like some jeans i had in the 90s. Good job  gap. I think these are my new favorite jeans. Crotch/inseam is lower than styles have been lately so a 32 inseam will be longer on the leg than their non-90s fit straight jeans 32 inseam will. The bad: The distressing is done on the cuffs of each leg. Around the bottom. When this cuff falls apart  jeans look really ratty. Distressing it early just accelerates the process. This is a small downside and probably true of most jeans that are made lightly distressed. Also  the front pockets are kind of small. Smaller than I'm used to. I have a normal smart phone (not like an XL model) and it fits  but barely.,mixed
Loved the fit of these jeans I am a petite women and they look amazing on  the wash on this model is a bit much but still pretty cool,positive
Boyfriend loved the pants,positive
fuller than 501s.  pre-distressed is good except for the bottom cuff/seam which will shorten the life of the jeans unnecessarily,positive
The jeans are too big   I washed them thinking that they was going to shrink but they didn't. I got them in my size 36 I should've went down a size,negative
These jeans are ok. If you're looking for a simple basic pair of black denim  this works. There is nothing special and I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality and unfortunately not what I was looking for.,negative
The fit is just okay.  I was expecting a bit moee flex.  I couldve sworn that older versions had more flex.  The recent batch I bought seemed a bit stiff.,negative
They're great and fit perfect,positive
My husband loves these jeans. It's his favourite cut.,positive
I love it,positive
I like that these pants look very 80's-90's,positive
These are some comfortable jeans,positive
I am a big fan of Gap jeans for many   many years. For some reason I never was into Levi's   Wrangler  Lee...etc. Found the cut of Gap jeans appeals to my style   comfort and durability. Have at least 35 pairs of Gap jeans (more than I can use ....) but I enjoy to wear them!,positive
Great fit!,positive
Good cut and fit. Slightly looser than skinny,mixed
Nice colour  good fitting  confortable. Everything was perfect.,positive
Amazing fitting,positive
From now on i will only buy my jeans at GAP  the perfect size and it's very durable material.,positive
Where do I begin. The Gap been the it brand since I was a kid I'm the 90s and I'm still making purchases from the clothing brand. Satisfied and will continue to shop with Gap!,positive
Great material,positive
#SweepStakes Great jeans as expected and as shown in the website. Very happy with my purchase.,positive
The fabric and flex is great. Been looking for a light blue wash jeans  Gap got it right. Thought the fit was a little fuller than I like  I will keep them.,positive
Perfect size. Good quality,positive
I love the color and how well they fit.,positive
Forgot how great Gap jeans were when I was young. I shop pretty extensively now at Gap!,positive
Elegant Fit,positive
Great cut for my husband who has narrow hips n skinny legs.,positive
Bought 2 pair of these. The length is perfect. For my son the waist was a bit big  be he loved them so much he just put on a belt and kept his shirt u tucked  problem solved.,positive
Soft and perfect fit.,positive
snug pair of jeans but not to snug just right,negative
"Bought them for my husband. He loves them! They're very comfortable  and look great on him. He's very picky so it was a gamble buying them without trying on. For reference he's 6'1""  205lbs and I got the 34/34s.",positive
Good fit not too baggy  not too skinny,positive
Nice color  fits very well.,positive
Husbands loved these. The shade is what caught my attention when I ordered. Great medium blue  jeans for him. He never liked slim fit but now he loves them bc they're not as tight as he thought they would be. He appreciates the stretch in them even tho he doesn't go for a snug look  but feel. Not to many whiskers and fades. They are just right,positive
Durable and form fitting,positive
It maybe to soon  but the jeans seem well made and look richer than their price.,positive
These fit great and were very comfortable. Will definitely buy again.,positive
Very comfortable great jeans,positive

These are my hubby's new favorite pair of dark denim jeans! They wash well & haven't faded!,positive
My son loves these jeans! He wanted jeans that had stretch and were comfortable. This is the pair!,positive
Tried and true… gap jeans just fit me the best.  I recently bought jeans from jcrew  and they were too tight around the thighs and too loose at my waist.  I'm not a thic guy.  Lol.  In gap  I'm a 31 slim.  Always seems to work just right.,mixed
Great jeans for my son  perfect fit.,positive
My son and son in love live these boot leg jeans!!! Perfect fit and length ALL the things me at a great price❤️,positive
There is alot of room in the thighs,neutral
Fits like how bootcut jean should fit. Fits right on the thigh and flares enough to give it the style I was looking for. Got it with additional discount which made me feel good about my purchase.,positive
Does not size well compared to other jeans...I returned these.,negative
Fit great and good quality,positive
I love the way these boot cut jeans wear and feel and have many pairs.  Not really into the skinny tapered look that feel too tight on me.,mixed
Great fit & material!,positive
Nice colour and weight,positive
My husband has been wearing these jeans for over a decade now. Just ordered two pair and they're not the same cut anymore. They're more like bell bottoms now. I don't understand why companies do this. Who asked you to change these? Why make a change without letting your customers know? Sadly  after being a loyal gap customer for so many years  now my husband is off to find a new brand of jeans.,negative
Great product and delivered as advertised.,positive
It fits perfect and very soft.,positive
Love them so far,positive
Most comfortable jeans I own,positive
Beautiful craftsmanship,positive
I have MANY pairs of Gap jeans and they usually fit very well  but these I have a problem with. The denim extends very little in the inside front pocket  and this combined with the thin and soft material causes the white inner pocket lining to be almost always visible as soon as I move or sit down. I didn't realize this before washing them or else I would have returned them. They're pretty much unwearable for this reason.,negative
These are some comfortable jeans,positive
Good fit. Perfect length,positive
Bought for boyfriend. He commented on how soft but strong the material is. Asked me to buy more immediately,neutral
Comfortable and stylish,positive
Perfect fit  has a stretch and the waste band Fits comfortable! True to size as well,positive

True to size and perfect fit. These are very comfortable jeans with just enough room around the thighs. Highly recommend!,positive
Very nice fit and colour! True to size.,positive
True to size. Great quality.,positive
soft against skin  breathable  and affordable.,positive
I'm almost 40 and think skinny jeans look ridiculous  that being said these are perfectly tight on the thighs and calf without needing butter to put on. Fit as well as $500 pairs I've had in the past.,mixed
Very nice fabric!,positive
Super comfy,positive
Not as simple as the look on these photos. I actually think that these photos are deceiving.,negative
I always buy these jeans for my spouse because they fit so well.  The other jeans are very baggy in the hip/butt area and look strange.  Also  they wash  well  as they say  so keep on making them!,mixed
a little big.  not so slim,neutral
Nice jeans,positive
I bought these to replace some aging 1969 Gap slim jeans. With the Gapflex feature they appear to be even more comfortable. I used to buy jeans at Banana Republic  but due to their unrealistically high prices I have moved on to Gap. The value is here.,mixed
Comfortable with a bit of stretch.,positive
Nice cut  flexible  don't bag out.,positive
Great fit and colour,positive
good,positive
Very comfy good fit.,positive
Great pair of jeans at a reasonable price.  Very comfortable.,positive
"The dark smudges and stains getting on  I understand as this is a beige pants and I need to be careful  but the wrinkles! Once it comes out of the dryer a couple of times  the jeans will have these thin wrinkle everywhere. Ironing it doesn't help... I can't recommend this and I am wondering this is due to ""Gapflex"" feature.",negative
Regular fit jeans  true to size.,neutral
I like the color  although the inseam is little bit long  I still like it.,positive
Great fit. True to size   Very nice denim fabric,positive
It's hard for me to find jeans that fit me well. It's either too tight or too long. Aside the fact this is a nice color  there needs to be a size 31-28.,mixed
Love! Great quality and color,positive
Great fit  great quality,positive

Fits good but don't like flex,positive
The perfect straight fit jeans.,positive
I absolutely love my GAP jeans.  They are comfortable  wear well and look great.  This is my 3rd & 4th pair since discovering them.  When needed in a few year to replace these I will be buying more for sure!,positive

Great fit and comfort. I'm fan of GAP Jeans.,positive
Love gap jeans,positive
I just bought two more pairs of these boot cut jeans because I like the way the feel and look.  Unfortunately  although it says it's exactly the same size  the inseam is longer than the other pair and it wears more baggy.  I'll be returning it.,mixed
My husband looks amazing he's 6'4 & 220 & these 38×36 are perfect.,positive
Comfortable  flattering! Great staple.,positive
Very Comfortable!!!,positive
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  He has veen wearing the standard fit for years and we can't get them anymore.  He said these jeans are super comfy!  They are a loose fit and are a very nice pair of jeans.  We will probably order another pair.,positive
Perfect fit! Amazing quality.,positive
Good was how my teenage son described these jeans. He liked the look of them and the fit.,positive
It's the first time to get  my husband said it is just he was looking.. fits perfectly. Size are true.,positive
Top jeans,neutral
Not a fan of tapered jeans I will not do that again love your jeans just nothing tapered,negative
Great fitting with a nice taper. Unfortunately I will be returning for a longer length.,mixed
I have always been a Gap shopper and I really love what the company has been doing for the last 3 years. The quality of the materials has improved a great deal. These jeans are a great mid to heavy weight denim and feel like they will wear in well. Only wish they were more tappered - fits like a straight leg.,positive
The quality is excellent,positive
Jeans fit well. I like the color.,positive
These are alot tighter then the other relaxed jeans.,neutral
no irritation on skin and comfortable while mobile,positive
Bought for my husband. Fit is great  he loves the stretch factor- just enough to feel comfortable and yet polished enough to wear to a casual work environment,positive
Great jeans. Enough room around my quads .,positive
best jeans ever,positive
Fit well. Looks good,positive
I LOVE these jeans in Black wash.  They literally fit PERFECT and look perfect!  Most black wash style jeans have those annoying wisker lines in the front pockets/zipper area  it's annoying and out of style. I'm an active live touring musician and I LOVE wearing these onstage and also for dates. I own 3 pairs and gonna buy a couple more pairs just incase they never get made the same again. Thanks GAP!,mixed
Great jeans at a great price!,positive
The stretch fabric is the best part in jeans nowadays - they are more comfortable.,positive
The staff at the store were very knowledgeable and doing an exchange was quick and easy . The garment quality and the service is why I have shopped at the Gap for many years . As well as nicely organized merchandise and welcoming store layout .,positive
The material is ok but I didn't like the feel or the way they fit,negative
Love this fit of these jeans! So comfy and the colorways are awesome. #sweepstakes,positive
Fit is ok,positive
I'm an older guy with a slim build. I don't believe in paying designer money for jeans. My daughter worked for the GAP in Daytona while in college. She bought me a pair of Slim GapFlex jeans. They were the best I've ever owned. I'm on my third  no fourth pair. and still rocking the first. This time I'm trying colors.,mixed
Flexible  soft fabric  comfortable to work with!,positive
I ordered the white/cream version the price is was unbeatable after a great discount. Gap made some changes to their fit. The jeans feel a little wider than in the past. Still  I love the Gap jeans.,positive
Great product  I purchased on line.They are a little bigger than previous purchased Gap jeans of the samestyle but they will work. Always a quality garment. Thank You.,positive
Great consistency in the colour and cut. Fits a bit loose for « slim » but quite well,positive

Perfect fit. Looks great. Great price. Would buy again,positive
"Nice to find jeans with 29"" length",positive
Perfect fit,positive

The jeans fit better than any others I've found.  My experience with GP goes  back decades: I have a heavy duty jacket that is about 30 years old  and is still comfortable  wearable  and keeps me warm.,positive
Good fit.,positive
I like the fit and soft feel.  It has enough stretch that it doesn't sag.,positive
Looking for men's jeans that did not have super baggy legs & could still accommodate a size 38 waist. These are it ! Creates overall slim look . Also wash well.,positive
Fabric is comfortable Fitting is not right.  Its loose around thighs till feet,negative
Fits great  super soft  great wash.,positive
Some jeans stretch more than others  and these did just that. Becoming lose at the end of the day is a little frustrating  but it is a nice and comfortable fit.,positive
They fit great and are very comfortable,positive
Love the fit and quality of this jeans.,positive
Great fit around my stomach,positive
Great jeans.  The stretch really makes the difference.  This slim fit is really a straight jean without the bagginess and its perfect for my husband's needs.,positive

I love Gap jeans. Great fabric. Great fit.,positive
Ordered 4 pairs  this was the only one where the length worked out  the Rest was too short,negative

Good fit and value for the money. Good quality,positive
Great jeans at a great price.,positive
"Wasn't sure what I was expecting with athletic taper  but it turned out I might not be the ""athletic taper"" type. If you're a slim fit person these will wear baggy.",neutral
too baggy in the tights,negative
All fit great and look great,positive
My husband absolutely loves this pair of jeans! He said he finally found a pair that fits perfectly in all the right places 10/10 recommend!,positive
My husband was in need of jeans and these fit the bill perfectly.  He loves the fit and the soft color.  A great purchase.,positive

Great jean with ample room in the thighs,positive
I've been buying Gap jeans for almostv30 years and I don't plan on ever stopping!,neutral
I love it,positive
Great jeans. They run true to size. That can be worn either casual with sneakers   t-shirt  hoodie or dressed up a little more with a nice sweater and casual shoes.,positive
These jeans fit great! I was very pleased with them.,positive
"Nice fit  especially for those who are shorter. Great that you offer 28"" length. Jeans are very comfortable and soft.",positive
I found this cut (or perhaps the pair sent) to be extremely loose through the hits and butt.  I have thick thighs  but these look more as if cut for female build.,negative
True to size and I really like the fit of them.,positive
Size 31 waist was too small so I ordered a 32 waist and it's too big. I'm swimming in it. I need to gain or lose weight I guess. Still these are my favorite fit of jeans for someone with big thighs.,mixed
Soft  stretchy and comfortable.  Great color! Perfect fit in the legs for any type of shoe.  The style and color go great with all types of shirts and tees.,positive
Good fit. As advertised.,positive
These fit my husband so well. He has a hard time finding jeans he thinks look stylish and also feel good and these do both.,positive
"I'm 6'9""  so I already find it hard to find jeans that fit with even the style and color that i would like. This jean hit home for me  compared to other jeans that i own  the quality is also great. I bought tall 36x36 athletic fit. The comfort and the style is a 10 out of 10 for me. Great 👖 jeans! I bought 2 more!",mixed
Good color  fit well.,positive
Great price for jeans!,positive
Great fit,positive
It's hard to find pants to fit my (tall  thin) growing teen. Old navy came through for us!,mixed
Perfect fit! Even after washing and drying.,positive
Very comfortable to wear,positive
These are ideal pants for most ever-day wear.,positive
I bought 2 jeans from last week. They made delivery only in 4 days. It is fast then I wish. The price is amazing and product are quality the I hope..I would give this GAP 5 stars now.,mixed
Material is soft  the cut is is great  and the colors make it easy to dress up or downThe length will shrink after a wash. Either hang dry or buy one inch longer,positive
"There Okay but I really miss the Straight ""Taper""  jeans.",negative
I bought this as a gift for my brother. I hope he likes it !,positive
The jeans have a nice comfortable straight fit which sits at waist as advertised. The dark wash looks great and can be easily dressed up or down. The denim is lightweight and should be comfortable in summer months. No branding or fancy stitching  just a solid pair of classic blue jeans.,positive
I love it. True to size and feels comfortable. I got compliments from my friends while wearing it. I will surely buy for more.,positive
These jeans disappointed on so many levels.  These pants were wide in the hips so they had an appearance that they ballooned out at the sides. Also  the online price (even with a 40%online discount)  was still more than DOUBLE the marked price. I call 1-800 customer disservice and learned that this was Gap's policy online and in store pricing were two separate things so too bad for me.  So these jeans are going back and I'll be looking for another brand of jeans,negative
Perfect fit,positive
it's a comfortable fit and the color is beautiful  just as it should be.,positive
Bought the athletic taper jeans last week and have worn them three days in a row since trying them on! They are a great fit  have a sleek look  and contain that slight stretch material  making it easy to move around (or enjoy an extra cookie or 3). I see a second pair coming my way shortly in the future!,mixed
Comfortable jeans.,positive
These were purchased for my son and he loves the fit,positive
They fit well. 1st bought my usual size but after wearing a couple of days felt a little loose. So went back for 1 inch smaller waist and they are better. Would prefer a little higher cotton and less stretch but I can live with these. I actually like them a little better than my Levi's.,mixed
My adult son loves the comfort of these jeans.  Best deals here on line at Gap!,positive
Great relaxing fit with some stretch  these are beyond comfortable..definitely a must have!The length is perfect!,positive
Nice quality  great fit  very reasonably priced and quick delivery,positive
Perfect fit,positive
It's hard to find jeans with an athletic fit that are also stylish. I love these jeans.,mixed
Fit is good. Roomier in butt and thigh but pants don't look baggy because the lower leg is tapered.,positive
Fantastic,positive
Perfect black pair of jeans for any occasion! They washed good surprisingly because they didn't fade!,positive
Perfect for my thick legs without being baggy or bulky.,positive
Love the fit and color.  Very sharp.  Super comfy with the Athletic Taper material and stretch.,positive
"Purchase This Item While You Can!!......this is my second purchase of this particular style/size of a denim jean by GAP......the item fits perfectly with NO flaws or discomfort while wearing.....I highly recommend this denim jean IF you ""fit"" the physical anatomy of which this jean is suited for....",positive
Fit well in the waist and legs.  Very comfy.,positive
Fit was what I expected and the price was great.,positive
great jeans i was expected them to be more black however they are nice and long and very impressive,positive
It's not always easy finding a slim jean that's not a legging or like I'm pretending to go to a Pearl Jam show. The latter has become more prevalent as kids think the 90s were cool. I find these to move and not hug. I enjoy they're not flopping around. Wash is good  not jet black and good thickness to texture ratio.  #sweepstakes,mixed
Super happy,positive
Pleased with the fit of the pants wish they were a little darker but it is evident through the photos they were a slightly lighter wash than straight black.,positive
It's Perfect,positive
best jeans I've ever had  they fit perfect.,positive
If you're into a slim fat  these are your jeans,neutral
Quality matches price,positive
My grandson has a slim build with long legs and these are the only great looking jeans that are sized that way.  They fit him sooo well.,positive
