819620002,Slim Jeans in GapFlex with Washwell,light wash,$55.00,5,Slim and Stretchy or No Deal.,I only wear GAP Jeans. But they have to be super stretchy material to fit my body. Gap keeps changing their nomenclature Softflex  or Gapflex. It's hard to keep up and the colour choices are limited. So when I find a colour I like I always order a few at a time.

455584002,100% Organic Cotton Button Fly '90s Original Straight Fit Jeans with Washwell,medium wash,$79.95,5,90s jeans are it,Great 90s silhouette  slight distress.
455584002,100% Organic Cotton Button Fly '90s Original Straight Fit Jeans with Washwell,medium wash,$79.95,5,Great Jeans,Wrote review as part of #sweepstakes.The good: Wash is really well done. Got compliments on it.Rise and fit are exactly like some jeans i had in the 90s. Good job  gap. I think these are my new favorite jeans. Crotch/inseam is lower than styles have been lately so a 32 inseam will be longer on the leg than their non-90s fit straight jeans 32 inseam will. The bad: The distressing is done on the cuffs of each leg. Around the bottom. When this cuff falls apart  jeans look really ratty. Distressing it early just accelerates the process. This is a small downside and probably true of most jeans that are made lightly distressed. Also  the front pockets are kind of small. Smaller than I'm used to. I have a normal smart phone (not like an XL model) and it fits  but barely.
455584002,100% Organic Cotton Button Fly '90s Original Straight Fit Jeans with Washwell,medium wash,$79.95,4,Great fit,Loved the fit of these jeans I am a petite women and they look amazing on  the wash on this model is a bit much but still pretty cool

455584002,100% Organic Cotton Button Fly '90s Original Straight Fit Jeans with Washwell,medium wash,$79.95,4,Fits  comfortable  consistent,fuller than 501s.  pre-distressed is good except for the bottom cuff/seam which will shorten the life of the jeans unnecessarily
455584002,100% Organic Cotton Button Fly '90s Original Straight Fit Jeans with Washwell,medium wash,$79.95,1,Too big,The jeans are too big   I washed them thinking that they was going to shrink but they didn't. I got them in my size 36 I should've went down a size
709140002,Slim Jeans in GapFlex with Washwell,black wash,$69.95,4,Simple and straightforward,These jeans are ok. If you're looking for a simple basic pair of black denim  this works. There is nothing special and I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality and unfortunately not what I was looking for.
709140002,Slim Jeans in GapFlex with Washwell,black wash,$69.95,3,Feels a bit stiffer than the ones from last year,The fit is just okay.  I was expecting a bit moee flex.  I couldve sworn that older versions had more flex.  The recent batch I bought seemed a bit stiff.

They're more like bell bottoms now. I don't understand why companies do this. Who asked you to change these? Why make a change without letting your customers know? Sadly  after being a loyal gap customer for so many years  now my husband is off to find a new brand of jeans.

455577002,Slim Jeans in SoftFlex with Washwell,resin rinse,$79.95,3,Nice but problem with the front pockets,I have MANY pairs of Gap jeans and they usually fit very well  but these I have a problem with. The denim extends very little in the inside front pocket  and this combined with the thin and soft material causes the white inner pocket lining to be almost always visible as soon as I move or sit down. I didn't realize this before washing them or else I would have returned them. They're pretty much unwearable for this reason.

720208002,Athletic Taper Jeans in GapFlex with Washwell,rinse,$69.95,1,Awful silhouette and no longer a gap customer,These jeans disappointed on so many levels.  These pants were wide in the hips so they had an appearance that they ballooned out at the sides. Also  the online price (even with a 40%online discount)  was still more than DOUBLE the marked price. I call 1-800 customer disservice and learned that this was Gap's policy online and in store pricing were two separate things so too bad for me.  So these jeans are going back and I'll be looking for another brand of jeans

720208002,Athletic Taper Jeans in GapFlex with Washwell,rinse,$69.95,5,Good fit.,They fit well. 1st bought my usual size but after wearing a couple of days felt a little loose. So went back for 1 inch smaller waist and they are better. Would prefer a little higher cotton and less stretch but I can live with these. I actually like them a little better than my Levi's.

Not too thin.,It's not always easy finding a slim jean that's not a legging or like I'm pretending to go to a Pearl Jam show. The latter has become more prevalent as kids think the 90s were cool. I find these to move and not hug. I enjoy they're not flopping around. Wash is good  not jet black and good thickness to texture ratio.  #sweepstakes
